# ocr-post-processing

We designed a post-processing framework to fix mistakes made during Tesseract OCR. We used Tesseract to OCR 17th century French texts and our framework became specifically tuned to the issues we faced. You will likely have to adapt the functions in main.py to fit suit your needs.
